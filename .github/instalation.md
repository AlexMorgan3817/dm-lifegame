### INSTALLATION

First-time installation should be fairly straightforward.  First, you'll need BYOND installed.  You can get it from [here](http://www.byond.com/download/).

This is a sourcecode-only release, so the next step is to compile the server files.
Open `life.dme` by double-clicking it, open the Build menu, and click compile.
This'll take a little while, and if everything's done right you'll get a message like this:

    saving life.dmb (DEBUG mode)
    life.dmb - 0 errors, 0 warnings

If you see any errors or warnings, something has gone wrong - possibly a corrupt download or the files extracted wrong, or a code issue on the main repo.
